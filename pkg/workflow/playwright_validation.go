// This file provides playwright tool validation for agentic workflows.
//
// # Playwright Mode Validation
//
// validatePlaywrightMode warns when playwright is configured in MCP mode
// (the default when no mode is specified, or when mode: mcp is set explicitly).
// MCP mode is deprecated in favor of CLI mode (mode: cli), which is more
// token-efficient and does not require a separate Docker container.
//
// # Migration
//
// To migrate from MCP mode to CLI mode:
//
//  1. Add `mode: cli` to your playwright tool configuration:
//
//     tools:
//       playwright:
//         mode: cli
//
//  2. Update prompts to use `playwright-cli <command>` via bash instead of
//     MCP browser tool calls. For example:
//     - Old: use browser_navigate MCP tool
//     - New: run `playwright-cli browser_navigate --url <url>` in bash
//
//  3. Use `localhost` directly when accessing local servers — playwright-cli
//     runs on the runner host, not in a separate Docker container.
